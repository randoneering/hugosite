#### About Me


As the name may suggest, I have plenty of hobbies. Coming from a family of talented artists and craftsmen and women, I have always liked to tinker with everything. While my profession is in IT, that has not restricted me from using some of the skills (and hobbies) I picked up along the way. This blog, site, KB article archive is meant for me to document my way through my various hobbies. Chances are, someone else out there has had the same question or itch. Therefore, I hope I can create some sort of content that you can enjoy or, atleast, learn from.


Privacy is also important to me, and therefore I will keep my family out of the picture. However, I am a proud father of three kids, a husband to an amazing wife, and a human trying to avoid negative energy.
