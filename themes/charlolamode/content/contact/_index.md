## About Me (Justin/Randoneering)

Privacy is important to me, and therefore I will keep my family out of the picture. However, I am a proud father of three kids, a husband to an amazing wife, and a human trying to avoid negative energy. While I enjoy spending time building complex systems, writing automation, expanding my love for Nix, I spend my spare time outside. I believe that everyone has a place in this world and that we should treat each other with the respect we deserve.

Like my personal life, I like to keep my professional life private as well out of the respect for the people I work with. However, I am happy to speak about my experience. Finally, I consider myself an Open Source Evangelist and find ways I can contribute to the tools I depend, whether that is by physical code contributions or simply by monetary donations.

This site's theme was inspired by a few things:
1) This Hugo [theme](https://github.com/charlola/hugo-theme-charlolamode)
2) My favorite theme for everything, [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/)
3) Minimal flashy animations. I don't need a headache trying to look through a website, neither do I want you to as well.
